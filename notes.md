# Git Hub Notes
I honestly learned a lot especially because I had to go back through this assignment 
after I was committing and pushing with my startup project. I learned how to resolve conflicts. I learned how to write to github and from github to vs code.

# Simon-CSS Deliverables
### Footer
I changed the footer a little bit because I didn't like how it was faded. I removed the bootstrap coloring and it went back to white.
### Gamer Name
I changed the color of the gamer because I felt like it seemed more seemless.
